<span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3"></span><p class="line874">Unfortunately, after many weeks of trying, we've come to the conclusion that we're not going to be able to support Dropbox integration any more, or at least, not in its current form.  It will be switched off sometime after 1 July 2015, and all existing Dropbox shares will be unshared then. <span class="anchor" id="line-4"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-5"></span><p class="line874">We've got some ideas about how we might be able to build some "one-off" download tools, as well as some options for on-demand / one-way sync, but it looks like we've reached the limits of the real-time sync client.  We're also investigating Dropbox's sharing API. <span class="anchor" id="line-6"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span><p class="line862">But for now, the status of the feature is unsupported.  If you have existing shares, we won't do anything to stop them syncing, but we can't guarantee that they'll continue to work reliably.  At some stage, we'll probably un-share those folders with you, and they will disappear from your <a href="./PythonAnywhere.html">PythonAnywhere</a> account.  But, don't worry, that's not going to happen overnight, and we'll give plenty of notice. <span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span><p class="line867">
<h3 id="All_is_not_lost.21">All is not lost!</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span><p class="line862">In the meantime, we'd like to encourage you to take a look at some of the <a href="./FTP.html">other options for getting code in and out of PythonAnywhere</a>.  Think of it as an upgrade!  Switching to a VCS-based system that uses Github or Bitbucket offers many advantages in terms of reliability, backups, and the-way-real-software-engineers-do-it-ness... <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span><span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div>
