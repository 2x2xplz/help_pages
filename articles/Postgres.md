Yes! You'll need to upgrade to a paying account.

In more detail:

  * If you have a free account, go to the Account page, and click on the "Change your custom plan" button. Switch the Postgres option on, choose how much disk space you want for your PG databases, choose any other paid features you want, and then click "Upgrade to this custom plan". This will take you through a payment confirmation process.
  * If you already have paying account, go to the Account page, and click on the "Customize your plan" button. The popup window will be pre-configured with all of your current custom plan settings, so you just need to switch the Postgres option on, choose how much disk space you want for your PG databases, and then click "Switch to this custom plan". This will take you through the normal payment confirmation process.
