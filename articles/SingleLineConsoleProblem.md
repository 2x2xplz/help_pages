##Help, my console is stuck on a single line!



###Refresh your browser cache


Sometimes this happens when we deploy new styling for the site. Clear your browser cache reload of all your CSS assets by doing a "force reload" -- depending on your web browser, you get this by shift+clicking or ctrl+clicking the refresh button, or ctrl+F5... 


###Reset your browser zoom


Sometimes the problem is due to the web browser's "zoom" function. 

You can reset the zoom level to default by hitting Ctrl+0 (Control-zero) 

Because the console tends to capture keypresses, you'll need to move the focus outside of the terminal. Click anywhere outside the console but inside the browser window... the URL bar, for example. Then hit Ctrl+0. 

Alternatively, you can use the "view" menu in your web browser.
