##How do I change the font size in a PythonAnywhere console?


To change the font size, **click on the console** and then use Control-+ to make the font larger or Control-- to make it smaller. 

Don't use the normal browser zoom function (from the browser's menu, or by using Control-+/Control-- with anything apart from the console itself focused) because that can cause problems with the console.
